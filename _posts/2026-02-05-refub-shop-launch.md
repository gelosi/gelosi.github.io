## Hardware at Price

Apple hardware nowadays is still a golden standard, many of us can not substitute. Hence, let's at least save another 10-30% (sometimes even more!), and 17% on average buying stuff from Apple. My take is [refub-shop](https://gelosi.github.io/refub-shop/).

- made with github pages, static, stupid, once a day gathers data. 
- works now only for EU. let me know if you really need that for North America (given delivery PITAs).
- funny, Swiss, the most luxurios country in the world has the cheapes iPhone (and apple tech overall) in Europe. Haha. Rich doesn't mean pay more. You do :p! 

And yes, it's done in Antigravity. However, it took me 46 commits and 20 days in total to bring it to the state of today.
